# Project-Etch-a-Sketch

A simple browser-based Etch-A-Sketch app built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Flexbox** — no CSS Grid used.

Users can sketch by hovering over a grid of squares that:
- Fill with a **random color** on first hover
- **Darken progressively by 10%** with each additional hover (up to black)
- Allow custom grid sizes and reset functionality
